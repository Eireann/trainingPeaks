  "readme": "# grunt-http-upload [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-http-upload.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-http-upload)\n\n> Upload files through POST/PUT HTTP request, using [Restler](https://github.com/danwrong/restler), the only Node library known to work flawlessly with multipart file uploads.\nSo now you can push a zip `/dist` through your CMS' API!\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you wonder how to install or use this plugin, or even Grunt itself, you should check out our [\"Discover Grunt\" book](http://www.discovergrunt.com).\n\nIt starts at the very beginning (including how to properly set-up your command-line on Windows and Mac OS X), and goes beyond the official [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-http-upload --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-http-upload');\n```\n\n## The \"http_upload\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `http_upload` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n\n  http_upload: {\n    your_target: {\n      options: {\n        url: 'http://example.com/template/123/?token=<%= config.apiKey %>',\n        method: 'PUT',\n        data: {\n          someKey: 'some value'\n        }\n      },\n      src: '<%= yeoman.dist %>/dist.zip',\n      dest: 'myField'\n    },\n  },\n\n})\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.url\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `''`\n\nThis is the full URL to which you can upload a file.\nYou can append some variables, like an API token.\n\n#### options.method\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `'POST'`\n\nThe HTTP method to use to upload the file.\nLook in the API documentation you want to use, this is usually POST or PUT.\n\n#### options.data\nType: `Object`\nDefaultValue: `{}`\n\nAny form data fields to be sent in addition to the file upload\n\n#### src\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `''`\n\nThe local path of the file you wish to upload, using the current working directory as a reference.\nYou can upload only 1 file at a time.\n\n#### dest\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `''`\n\nThe field name of the file to be uploaded, on the API side.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Default Options\nIn this example, the default POST method is used to upload the local picture `./images/status.jpg` to Basecamp. Their API can be accessed through the URL `https://basecamp.com` (using Basic Auth). When creating an attachment in Basecamp, the \"dest\" field name is not important, so you can set it to anything (`img` in this case).\n`method` is set to \"POST\", but could have been omitted as this is the default value.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  http_upload: {\n    basecamp: {\n      options: {\n        url: 'https://user:pwd@basecamp.com/99999999/api/v1/attachments.json',\n        method: 'POST'\n      },\n      src: 'images/status.jpg',\n      dest: 'img'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\nYou should fork this repo, and issue a Pull Request with your proposed changes.\n\n### Roadmap ideas\nFor now the upload is limited to 1 file per target. This could change if I find a scenario needing it.\nAlso, it is not possible to add additional payload (no custom data). A lot of API require the Authentication to be sent through the Headers, so this might be one of the next improvement.\n\n## Release History\n0.1.0 - 2013-10-30: Initial release. Supports only 1 multipart file upload.\n",
