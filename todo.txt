US642 TODO:

webapi save

compare all tabs to app.dev

refactor to make everything reuseable:
	what are the differences between tabs? especially labels and tool tips
	extract hr specific details
	point tool tip data
	tool tip template
	build from settings
	view base class?
	some of the peak calculation probably doesn't belong in chartbuilder

watch for settings change/load in qv tabs if athlete settings haven't loaded yet

workout type change - how does this effect existing 'time in zones' data? do we re-display based on settings? or would it change on server?

watch for workout type change - discuss behavior for existing workouts w/ data

default zones for new users - where or how? or, what about existing users that have no zones?

8) will we have a story to change the charts to flot? and improve design?


BDD TESTS:
zones and meanmax
stickit and autosave
late loading of athlete settings
cancel
changing workout type
get full test set to work, and check coverage
how to deal w/ bdd tests not running in browser?
