US642 TODO:

HR TAB:

initial peaks structure
initial zones structure
fix NAN
test stickit
extract hr specific details
refactor tool tips

2) stickit bindings for peaks
update charts on change, only on blur/change
3) autosave on blur
4) autosave on timeout
3) integrate checkpoint and cancel
4) refactor, especially data building, stickit building, and autosave building
- and templates can we combine across tabs?
- could we even have a common tab base class?
- some of the peak calculation probably doesn't belong in chartbuilder
5) watch for settings change/load in qv tabs
6) watch for workout type change - discuss behavior for existing workouts w/ data
7) do we display and graph zero values for peaks?
8) will we have a story to change the charts to flot? and improve design?

throbbers on details instead of workout change

BDD TESTS:
zones and meanmax
stickit and autosave
late loading of athlete settings
cancel
changing workout type
get full test set to work, and check coverage

REPEAT FOR OTHER TABS

how to deal w/ bdd tests not running in browser?
