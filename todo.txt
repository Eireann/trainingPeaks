US642 TODO:

webapi save

power tab

compare all tabs to app.dev

some of the peak calculation probably doesn't belong in chartbuilder

remove all unused files

watch for settings change/load in qv tabs if athlete settings haven't loaded yet

workout type change - how does this effect existing 'time in zones' data? do we re-display based on settings? or would it change on server?

watch for workout type change - discuss behavior for existing workouts w/ data

default zones for new users - where or how? or, what about existing users that have no zones?

8) will we have a story to change the charts to flot? and improve design?


BDD TESTS:
zones and meanmax
stickit and autosave
late loading of athlete settings
cancel
changing workout type
get full test set to work, and check coverage
how to deal w/ bdd tests not running in browser?
